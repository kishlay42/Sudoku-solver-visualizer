# Sudoku Solver Visualizer

## 1/ About this project

This project is a web-based application designed to solve and visualize the process of solving Sudoku puzzles using the backtracking algorithm. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface. The solver not only finds the solution to a given Sudoku puzzle but also visually demonstrates how the backtracking algorithm navigates through the puzzle, making decisions, and backtracking when necessary until the puzzle is solved.

## 2/ Web app version

The web app version of the Sudoku Solver Visualizer allows users to input their Sudoku puzzles and watch in real-time as the algorithm solves the puzzle. The visualizer highlights the current cell being processed, shows possible numbers being considered, and visually indicates when backtracking occurs. This educational tool is perfect for those interested in learning more about the backtracking algorithm, how it can be applied to solve Sudoku puzzles, and for anyone looking to solve puzzles instantly.

### Features:

- **Interactive Sudoku Board:** Users can input their puzzles directly into the board or select from pre-defined puzzles.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization:** The app visualizes each step of the backtracking algorithm, including selections, conflicts, and backtracks.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to be responsive, making it accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Performance Metrics:** After solving, the app displays performance metrics such as the time taken to solve the puzzle and the number of backtracks performed.

### Technologies Used:

- **HTML:** Structures the web app's layout.
- **CSS:** Styles the Sudoku board and controls, providing a responsive and intuitive interface.
- **JavaScript:** Implements the backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles and manages the visualization and user interactions.

This project is an excellent resource for both puzzle enthusiasts looking to solve Sudoku puzzles effortlessly and learners interested in understanding the backtracking algorithm's application in solving complex problems.
